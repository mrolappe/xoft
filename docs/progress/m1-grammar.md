# M1 — Grammar

## M1.1 — vendor base grammar ✅ (round 2, 2026-08-10)

`grammars/tree-sitter-oberon2/` now holds `viegasfh/tree-sitter-oberon-2` (MIT, commit
`bb5282d6`) minus the checked-in parser: `grammar.js`, `package.json`, `LICENSE`,
`test/corpus/*` (5 files, upstream). `NOTICE` records both fork origins and commits.

`tree-sitter generate` runs clean under CLI 0.26.11 — no rule changes were needed, only two
warnings (ABI 14 fallback because there is no `tree-sitter.json`; one unnecessary `seq` in the
`comment` rule). `tree-sitter test` is 14/14 green on the upstream corpus.

`src/` (parser.c, grammar.json, node-types.json, tree_sitter/*) is generated, not committed —
gitignored via `grammars/*/src/` in the root `.gitignore`, regenerate with `tree-sitter
generate` before `tree-sitter test` or any parse.

### M1.5 — highlights.scm ✅ (done in the same pass, cheap)

`queries/highlights.scm` is adapted from `geekstakulus/tree-sitter-oberon-07` (MIT, commit
`162c3432`), rewritten against this grammar's actual node names — the two forks share a
skeleton but diverge on field names (this grammar has no `param:`/`paramtype:`/`returntype:`
fields, and no `base_type` wrapper around builtin qualidents outside record extension).
Validated with `tree-sitter query queries/highlights.scm <file>` against the corpus and
`examples/Hello.Mod` from upstream — captures are sane on everything the grammar actually
parses.

Sanity-checked `Hello.Mod` end to end and confirmed by hand a gap already logged in
`docs/insights.md`: `Out.Ln;` followed directly by `END` produces an `ERROR` node, because
`statement_seq` has no empty-statement alternative. This is the documented M1.2b gap, not a new
bug — left alone per the task boundary ("do not start adding missing constructs").

## M1.2a / M1.2b / M1.2c / M1.3 — not started

See `NEXT.md` for the current task and `docs/insights.md` for the full list of gaps against the
EBNF baseline these subtasks close.
